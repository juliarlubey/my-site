		<h1>SPOONING WITH GIADA [fall 2016]</h1>
		<p>serial murders & cereal orders // <a href="http://www.wbar.org/shows/F16/spooning%20with%20giada/memory-0/">check a playlist</a> // <a href="http://www.wbar.org/shows/F16/spooning%20with%20giada/memory-3/">and another</a></p>
		<p><b>Spooning With Giada:</b> I'm currently doing this show with my friends ben arenstein and preston olson. we start each show with a recipe from giada di laurentiis' show in the first hour and a murder mystery in the second hour. there's jokes, sketches, discussion of facts, and quiz nights. we have various guests on when they feel like coming and play music we think each murderer would listen to [or giada would listen to]. listen in, on tuesdays from 10pm to 12am.</p>
		<p><b>type of music:</b> murder</p>

		<h1>DAD THAT'S LAME [spring 2016]</h1>
		<p>previously known as platonic co-showers // <a href="http://www.wbar.org/shows/S16/dad%20that's%20lame/memory-13/">check a playlist</a> // <a href="http://www.wbar.org/shows/S16/dad%20that's%20lame/memory-8/">and another</a></p>
		<p><b>Platonic Co-Showers:</b> I accidently messed up the name and description of this show so it no longer shows what it actually was in the spring of 2016. I did this one on my own, and named it after a potential band name that my friend caroline came up with [a game we like the play in case either of us ever ends up in a band]. finally I got a nice time, and was on wednesday from 6pm to 8pm. finally there were real people listening live instead of using the archive. there was no real theme to this show, just me playing music for myself.</p>
		<p><b>type of music:</b> 70's ballads, 80's rock, 90's grunge, 2000's rap</p>

		<h1>VERMONT'S FINEST BEN & JULIA'S [fall 2015]</h1>
		<p>every week a new flavour // <a href="http://www.wbar.org/shows/F15/Vermont's%20Finest%20BJ/memory-11/">check a playlist</a> // <a href="http://www.wbar.org/shows/F15/Vermont's%20Finest%20BJ/memory-10/">and another</a></p>
		<p><b>Vermont's Finest Ben & Julia's:</b> I did this show with my friend ben arenstein. as I was working at ben & jerry's at the time, we dedicated each week's show to a flavour of their ice cream. this was another gross 2am to 4am show, but it was much easier to stay up with another person in the studio. this show was mostly us bs-ing the entire time, but we did play music sometimes.</p>
		<p><b>type of music:</b> reggae, rap, 80's ballads</p>

		<h1>CNY FAMOUS [spring 2015]</h1>
		<p>the one that started it all // <a href="http://www.wbar.org/shows/S15/cnyfamous/memory-2/">check a playlist</a> // <a href="http://www.wbar.org/shows/S15/cnyfamous/memory-11/">and another</a></p>
		<p><b>cnyfamous:</b> the name people from central new york give to people from the area think they are a big deal, but are actually only known in CNY. this was my first show with wbar as a little first-year, and I received the coveted 2am-4am time slot on wednesdays. despite this disgusting time, I never missed a show and consistently uploaded playlists [which we're supposed to do but no one ever does!]. unfortunately, there's literally no one awake at 2am to listen to an online radio show. I did get a few consistent listeners who would use the archive, though!</p>
		<p><b>type of music played:</b> alt-rock, college rock, speedy ortiz</p>
